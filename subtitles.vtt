00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.880
after reading tons of productivity books

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.000
I came across so many rules like the

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.279
2-year rule the 5 minute rule the 5c

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:09.599
rule no not that 5-second rule the

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.000
problem is that these rules were meant

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.960
for companies or entrepreneurs but I was

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.839
able to adapt them to my studies during

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.800
med school and drastically cut down in

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.400
my procrastination so I'm going to share

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.800
with you two different two-minute rules

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.920
for the next 2 minutes the first 2

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.400
minute rule comes from getting things

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.480
done by David Allen he says if it takes

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.039
2 minutes to do get it done right now

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.519
for example if I need to take out the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.960
trash today it takes 2 minutes to do so

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.879
if I'm thinking about it now might as

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.480
well just do it now instead of writing

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.079
it down on a to-do list or probably

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.559
forgetting about it or having to come

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:43.960
back to it later which takes more than 2

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.760
minutes that's how I see it so here's a

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.840
list of things that might take 2 minutes

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.640
throughout the day like organizing your

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.120
desk or Watering your plants or clipping

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.359
those nasty Nails I just do it when I

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:55.840
notice it but these little things start

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.000
to add up so this rule biases my brain

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.519
towards taking action and away from

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:02.000
procrastination the second two-minute

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.800
rule comes from Atomic Habits by James

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.439
Clear he says when you're trying to do

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.280
something you don't really want to do

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.280
simplify the test down to 2 minutes or

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.960
less so doing your entire reading

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.640
assignment becomes just reading one

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.880
paragraph or memorizing the entire

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.360
periodic table becomes memorizing just

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.640
10 flash cards now some of you might

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.119
think yeah this is just a Jedi mind

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.320
trick like why would I fall for it how

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.880
is this at all sustainable and to that

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.960
he says when you're starting out limit

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.439
yourself to only only 2 minutes so back

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.399
in med school I wanted to build a habit

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:35.840
of studying for 1 hour every day before

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.399
dinner so I tried this trick but I

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.439
limited myself to Just 2 minutes I'd sit

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.240
down open my laptop study for 2 minutes

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.960
and then Clos my laptop and went to do

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.240
something else it seems unproductive at

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.280
first right it seems stupid but staying

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.560
consistent with this two-minute routine

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.280
day after day meant that I was becoming

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.719
the type of person who studies daily I

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.159
was mastering the habit of just showing

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.280
up because a habit needs to be

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.719
established before it can be expanded

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.640
upon if I can't become a person who

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.080
studies for Just 2 minutes a day I'd

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.080
never be able to become the person that

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.080
studies for an hour a day you got to

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.200
start somewhere but starting small is

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.120
easier there's a lot of other useful

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.319
tips from books I cover more here in

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.640
